Travel Explorer Website
‚úàÔ∏è Project Overview
The Travel Explorer Website is a lightweight, single-page application designed to simplify the initial stages of trip planning. Users can quickly search for any global destination to instantly view essential information, including current weather conditions and a gallery of high-quality photos. This project eliminates the need to jump between multiple platforms, providing a clean and intuitive interface for exploration.

‚ú® Key Features
Destination Search: Users can input any city or destination to retrieve data.

Real-time Weather: Displays current temperature (in Celsius) and weather description powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.

Dynamic Photo Gallery: Fetches and displays a grid of beautiful, high-resolution images of the destination using the Unsplash API.

Clean, Responsive Design: Built with modular HTML and CSS for an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Styling	CSS3	Responsible for clean aesthetics and responsive layouts.
Interactivity	JavaScript (ES6+)	Handles the core logic, API calls, and dynamic UI updates.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need to obtain API keys for the external services:

OpenWeatherMap: Sign up and get your API Key.

Unsplash: Register as a developer and get your Access Key.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY LINK]
cd travel-explorer-website
Insert API Keys:

JavaScript

const OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'; 
const UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY';
Run Locally:
Since this is a static website, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can use a local server extension (like VS Code's Live Server) for development.

üí° Future Scope (Enhancements)
User Accounts: Implement a backend (e.g., Node.js) to allow users to create accounts and save their favorite destinations.

Itinerary Planner: Integrate features to help users plan and save a multi-day itinerary.

Maps Integration: Use a Maps API (like Google Maps) to display a location map and points of interest.

Advanced Search: Implement auto-suggestion and more robust error handling for user inputs.

Loading States: Enhance the user experience with better visual loading indicators during API fetch times.
